# benjimanclarke.tech  
What is this inventively named site? Well.....  
- It is a single place where I can show off my work in some detail with personal commentary on each project
- It is a place where I can mess around and play woth HTML/CSS/Bootsrap and other static webpage tools
- Any of my self-hosted tools are stemmed from this url ***service.benjimanclarke.tech***, so having a place where I can list these will prove useful  

### Why static website? React/Angular/Ruby on rails/Django are way better for websites!  
Better for web applications, yes! For simple, non-changing elements with a simple layout and ease of maintainence, no!  
Ever heard of KISS? Keep It Simple Stupid.... it's a very simple üòÖ philosophy. I am simply ü•∞ putting images and text on a page with some predefined css attributes to make it look somewhat pretty. I am using Ruby and Sinatra combined with Bootstrap as my "tech stack" purely because it is easy to maintain, requires little to no effort deploy and I can add ruby gems to the site if I am feeling fancy some day. I am also using ruby in my day job so it would make sense for me to keep my head in the ruby game at the moment. Feel free to ping me on twitter if you need any more clarification on my choices. 

### Why not use flask? Python is better.  
Flask ü§ù Sinatra  
Believe it or not, they are basically the same thing just for a different language. Both have their strong and weak points, but for what I am doing Sinatra works perfectly fine.  
Python being better is really a matter of opinion. My company uses Ruby as it's main language so to help me get more familiar with the syntax I decided to use Ruby. I learned coding in university with Python and Java so I am way more confortable with Python and Flask but in the interest of learning, I am using Ruby and Sinitra.
